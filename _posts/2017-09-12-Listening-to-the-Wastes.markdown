Original work. This is an updated piece of something Amanda did with pen, ink, and on canvas back in 2011. The person is listening to their favorite music, while in front of the silhouette of a dying tree.

The medium is digital, Color, while using the program Clip Studio Paint. A Wacom Intuos Art Tablet is used for the drawing process.
