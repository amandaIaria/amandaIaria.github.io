Helping Yourself to Health is a site I worked while at HMC advertising. We worked with the Vermont Department of Health to create a site that focused on multiple topics. With the help of HMC's designers and writers I create a full wordpress theme, and a video Wordpress Plugin that allowed easy viewing of the programs stories in shortcode format. View the site at <a href="http://myhealthyvt.org/" target="_blank">http://myhealthyvt.org/</a>.
