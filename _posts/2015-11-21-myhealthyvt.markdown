Helping Yourself to Health is a site Amanda worked on while at HMC Advertising. They worked with the Vermont Department of Health to create a site that focused on multiple health topics. With the help of HMC's designers and writers they create a full WordPress theme, and a video Wordpress Plugin that allowed for easy viewing of the programs stories in shortcode format.
