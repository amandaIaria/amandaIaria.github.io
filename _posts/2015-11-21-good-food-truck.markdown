The Good Food Truck is a site Amanda worked on while at HMC Advertising. They worked with the CEFs (Chittenden Emergency Food Shelf). The project included the site, branding, shirts, printables, and the food truck design. With the help of HMC's Designers, they built the site, child theme, and two plugins. The Twitter map and feed, along with the Instagram feed. Both plugins can be found on the front page. You can view the site at <a href="http://goodfoodtruckvt.org/" target="_blank">http://goodfoodtruckvt.org/</a>.
