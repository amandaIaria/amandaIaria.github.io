The Good Food Truck is a site I worked while at HMC advertising. We worked with the CEFs (Chittenden Emergency Food Shelf), and the project included the site, branding, shirts, printables, and the truck design. With the help of HMC Designers I built the site, child theme, and with two plugins. The Twitter map and feed, and the Instagram feed. Both plugins can be found on the front page. You can view the site at <a href="http://goodfoodtruckvt.org/" target="_blank">http://goodfoodtruckvt.org/</a>.
