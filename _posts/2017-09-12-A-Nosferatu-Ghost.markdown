Original Work. This character is an antagonist from a World of Darkness tabletop campaign Amanda was Game Mastering in. The concept is that of a Nosferatu Ghost, the ghost of a dead vampire from the Nosferatu clan.

The medium is digital, Black and White, while using the program Clip Studio Paint. A Wacom Intuos Art Tablet is used for the drawing process.
