Original Work. A modern shaman from a dystopian world. While playing games such as Fallout 4, Rifts, or Shadowrun I had the idea for a character that held shamanistic beliefs. They lived in a dying world, and they felt that it was their duty to rescue it.

The medium is digital, Black and White, while using the program .
