Original Work. A modern shaman from a dystopian world. While playing games such as Fallout 4, Rifts, or Shadowrun Amanda had the idea for a character that held shamanistic beliefs in a futuristic apocalyptic world. The character lived in a dying world and felt that it was their duty to rescue it from destruction.

The medium is digital, Black and White while using the program Clip Studio Paint. A Wacom Intuos Art Tablet is used for the drawing process.
