Snap is a site I worked on while at HMC advertising. We worked with the Vermont Department of Health to create a site that focused on eating healthy for low income Vermonters. Unlike many of the other sites I've worked on this one is a static landing page. We had a lot of information to work with, and had the challenge to orginize it in such a way that it would be easy to navigate. View the site at http://www.healthyinasnapvt.org/
