Snap is a site Amanda worked on while at HMC Advertising. They worked with the Vermont Department of Health to create a site that focused on eating healthy for low-income Vermonters. They had a lot of information to work with and had the challenge to organize it in such a way that it would be easy to navigate and appealing.
