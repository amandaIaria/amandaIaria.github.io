ParentUp is a site I worked while at HMC advertising. We worked with the Vermont Department of Health to create a site that focused on multiple issues for parents. Some of the topics included Drug and Alcohol Abuse, depression, and suicide. With the help of HMC's designers and writers I create a full wordpress theme, and a plugin for the Set the Foundation page. This page contains a mass amount of information that had to be easily ingested with good UX experience. View the site at http://parentupvt.org/
