In 2017 as a way to re familliarize myself with C# I started to take a Unity Game engine class. This is the first 'true' game from the course. It's a simple text-adventure game that only takes 5 mins (at the most) to complete. <a href="https://tragicallyhipster.itch.io/the-path" target="_blank">https://tragicallyhipster.itch.io/the-path</a>.
