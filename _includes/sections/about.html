					Amanda Iaria has been working on web projects for over ten years. They first started in high school making fan sites in 2000. Since then they has grown from their experiences and has gained knowledge beyond that of a hobbyist.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2010, they went back to college to get their Bachelor's Degree in Web Development from Champlain College, then graduated in 2013. A few months after they started working for HMC Advertising.
				</p>
				<p>
					Their senior thesis was an online Data-based RPG Character Sheet that used their own CMS. The project allowed the user to create their own saveable Pathfinder&trade; character which could be edited and shared with others. It aspired to be more user friendly than other similar RPG Character Sheets that were in use. For now the project is offline, but they hopes in the future to revitalize it.
				</p>
				<p>
					While working at HMC some of their first projects included 802Quits, OnCall for Vermont, and My Healthy VT. These ranged from full sites, to plugins and landing pages. Each had their own challenges to overcome. One such challenge was in the site called Parent Up. This site in particular had a huge amount of information which needed to be organized in such a manner as to not overwhelm the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					In May of 2016 they were hired at Dealer.com, a local tech company that focuses on websites for dealerships, but that was only the tip of the iceberg. They joined an engineering team that is dedicated to Subaru of America's sites. (T2 (regional) - T3 (local dealership) ) We combine multiple APIs from Subaru and third-party companies in order to serve, not only the dealership, but also the public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amanda specializes as a Full Stack Developer, as they works with PHP, mySQL, and HTML.  However, that doesn't mean they won't try learning new things. They has a rough familiarity in Ruby, and C#, and they are now learning Game Engines like Unity with C# and RPG Maker with Ruby.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other than working, Amanda enjoys movies, video games, reading and drawing.
